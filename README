super mega early beta of ubersystem running in a container
ULTRA EXPERIMENTAL RIGHT NOW
-Dom

for dev environments (HYPER EXPERIMENTAL) do this:

./build.sh to build the image

then

./setup-dev.sh

This will take the uber base image and run it with a command which will
copy all the code from /uber into the data volume. This is mounted from the 
host in the 'app' directory here.

The command then setups ubersystem to run with the code in the volume.

The entire point of this is the host OS can access the data volume and 
edit the running code inside the docker container.

DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION. However, it's very useful in development.

ONLY RUN THIS SCRIPT ONCE or it will overwrite your code changes with the
stock code inside the container.

-----------

ULTRA EXPERIMENTAL, can't stress that enough.  Also there's a bunch of dumb
things we should fix in here.  Dom and Thaeli are on it.
